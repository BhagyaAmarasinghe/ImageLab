# Roles- Annotator

## What is Annotator's Role?

Every project can have multiple collaborators. A collaborator can be an admin, annotator or reviewer. An admin can annotate and review. An annotator can only annotate, not review. A reviewer is usually a subject matter expert, they can review annotations (and add modifications to annotations)

Annotator can only add or modify annotations. They will also see reviews from reviewers.
