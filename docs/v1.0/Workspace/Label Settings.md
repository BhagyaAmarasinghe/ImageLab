## Class Names and Count of Labels

Each class name is represented by a box and a count of number of labels for that particular class.

## Form Data for Classes and Their Attributes

Each class has associated form-data that needs to be populated by the annotator.

Some parts of form-data might be "required", i.e. they are mandatory.

If annotator tries to save an annotation without entering "required" data entry, an error will be flashed as shown in image below:
